# hotelery coding challenge

Welcome to hotelery's coding challenge. We are happy and thankful that you want to work with us. __Thank you__!

The coding challenge usually takes roughly 15 to 20 minutes.

Here are the tasks you need to solve:

* Dynamically load data from the SpaceX GraphQL api.
  * Retrieve only the needed data and update the TS interface
* Implement loading state using `@mui/material/Skeleton`.
* Limit the retrieved items using the existing constant `limit` located in `src/components/Content.tsx:6`.
* Reload data whenever the value of the `limit` constant (mentioned above) changes.
* Find and fix possible code errors.

Thank you very much in participating and happy coding! ðŸš€
